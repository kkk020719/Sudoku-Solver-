# Sudoku-Solver-
This is a final project for COMP250 and the program that lets users enter a classical and chess sudoku puzzle and see the solution (if one exists).


A Chess Sudoku puzzle is a classic Sudoku puzzle with the addition of one or more of the following chess inspired rules:
• Knight Rule: a digit must not appear a chess knight’s move away from itself. Knights in chess move forming an L shape: either two squares vertically and one horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. See this figure for a graphical representation.
• King Rule: a digit must not be a King’s move away from itself. Which to the classical rules of Sudoku only adds the fact that a digit cannot be a single diagonal move away from itself.
• Queen Rule: every 9 in the grid acts like a chess Queen and must not be in the same row/column/3x3 box or diagonal of any other 9.
